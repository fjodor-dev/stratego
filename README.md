# stratego

this is a project of the game stratego that i made with java and javaFX. 
the things i treid to practice/learn with this project where:

  being consistand with encapsulation(Setters/Getters),
  java lists,
  try/catch,
  static keyword,
  final keyword,
  static classes that you apperently dont hef in java so i tried simulating static classes with setting evry member static and the constructer to private so we cant     instanceied the class exemples of that are the Bord Class and the GameSettings Class,
  protected access modifier(this dindt work like i thought it would work like),
  inheretence,
  abstract classes (Piece Class),
  planing of a projecht with UML,
  basic concepts of polymorphism like:
    overiding,
    list/arryas fild of type superclass with subclasses,
    method/constructer overlaoding(that i ended up not using add all),
  working with scene builder with FXML file's,

the only thing that i coudn't figure out was how can configure packages so you can make full use of all the acces modifiers and certain shield of methods i faild at this

i think the time that i spend on this is around 50 hours that is with all the learnig included. i think i spend atleast 15 hours of pure learning trew watching youtube and reading forms and ducumentations and another 6 or so planning and the rest coding in eclipse and doing some minor graphical stuff
