# stratego




this is a project of the game Stratego that i made with java and JavaFX. i tried to mostly making it in a way that you can expend the scale of the project with inheritance and other stuff like this. because of this i could easily add extra settings to the game like playing a smaller game and movable Flags and Bom’s for example. the things i tried to practice/learn with this project where:

being consistent with encapsulation(Setters/Getters),
java lists,
try/catch,
static keyword,
final keyword,
static classes that you apparently don’t heff in java so i tried simulating static classes with setting every member static and the constructer to private so we cant instanced the class examples of that are the Bord Class and the Game Settings Class,
protected access modifier(this didn’t work like I thought it would work like),
inheritance,
abstract classes (Piece Class),
planning of a project with UML,
working with scene builder with FXML file's,
basic concepts of polymorphism like: 
  overriding,
   list/arrays filed of type superclass with subclasses,
  method/constructer overloading(that I ended up not using add all),

the only thing that i couldn’t figure out was how can configure packages so you can make full use of all the access modifiers and certain shielding of of methods i failed at this for now.

i think the time that i spend on this is around 50 hours that is with all the learning included. i think i spend at least 15 hours of pure learning threw mostly watching YouTube and reading forms and documentations and another 6 or so planning and the rest coding in eclipse and doing some minor graphical stuff.

i heff no idea how i can make a decent application of this yet, but i think the most important part was the use of OOP.
